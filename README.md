# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions  
🚀 Python | Scikit-learn | Plotly | 2025  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **fraud detection system** using multiple **machine learning models** to predict fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. The system is trained on a dataset of **28,221 transactions** and evaluated using **10-fold cross-validation** for accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of:  

✅ **28,221 transactions** containing features like transaction type, amount, and account balances.  
✅ **Target variable**: **isFraud** (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

**Data preprocessing** includes handling missing values and encoding categorical features for model training.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

## 📖 Model Architecture  
Multiple machine learning models were implemented for fraud detection, including:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Trees**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Naive Bayes (NB)**  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

**Evaluation** was done using **10-fold cross-validation** to ensure robust model performance.

## 📊 Performance  
- **High accuracy** achieved in detecting fraudulent transactions.  
- Evaluated using **accuracy** and **cross-validation** metrics.
